              <p>This webpage was made with the soul intention of practicing and playing around with Bootstrap styling. It's
                currently filled with mumbo jumbo and ipsum, but with time it could turn into a legit Vacation Plan! In a
                way, its currently not too far off from my idea of a good trip.</p>

              <p>Here was my first time practicing css styling with span elements. It was fun to come up with ridiculous content
                for a mystery man's resume. Threw it in the list because I thought you might get a kick out of it
                <span class="quiet">if your a dork like myself</span>.

              <p>This is my very first webpage I ever made, about 2 years ago. It's very unorganized and the GitHub-pages currently
                does not work, but unside the repo you'll find many files where I have breif notes about what I was teaching
                myself at the time. Despite it being unpresentale currently, it has a good amount of sentimental value to
                me, and I look forward to cleaning it up within the next couple weeks in my spare time.</p>

        <h3 class="h">Background</h3>

        <p>I bounced around with ideas about what I wanted to do after high school, but when I graduated and the time came to
          pick something, I still wasn't sure, so I decided not to go to college despite all my friends going. I wanted to
          be sure about what I wanted before I threw money at it. The only idea I had at that point was graphic design, and
          I didn't truly understand what the path was for it. I ended up going to a conference about graphic design and web
          development, interviewed a graphic designer, and realized I feel pulled more towards
          <span class="favorites">web devlopement</span> than graphic design. I looked into it further on my own and decided it was what I wanted
          to do. I tried teaching myself for a few years, and came to find I need a structured system to truly grow to my
          fullest potential. So here I am, at Epicodus, making my first portfolio.
          <em>It's going to be a blast!</em>

        <h3 class="h">Passions</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Weight Lifting / Fitness</li>
          <li>Painting</li>
          <li>Playing Guitar</li>
          <li>Playing board games with friends and family</li>
          <li>Bullet journaling / writing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All my life I've been an artist of some sort. I've drawn since I could hold a pencil, which led to me doing digital
          illitration for a couple years, which then led to painting. I've played piano since I was 4, but these days I lean
          more towards guitar. Most of my artistic expression comes from
          <span class="favorites">music</span> these days, but I will latch hook when I want something tedious and visual to do with my hands. Besides
          art and music, I've found I'm at my happiest when I work out most days of the week, and really enjoy
          <span class="favorites">weightlifting</span>. It gives me a sense of accomplishment to struggle under the barbel yet still complete the
          set to my best ability. Other than that, I love lounging around with friends and family, playing strategy games,
          and reflecting on my life and goals and planning for the future.</p>

        <p>Here are two of my favorite paintings that I made:</p>
