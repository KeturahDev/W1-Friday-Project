      <a href="https://keturahdev.github.io/Vacation/">Vacation-Plan</a>
      <p>This webpage was made with the soul intention of practicing and playing around with Bootstrap styling. It's currently
        filled with mumbo jumbo and ipsum, but with time it could turn into a legit Vacation Plan! In a way, its currently
        not too far off from my idea of a good trip.</p>

      <p>In this Webpage, my pairing pairing partner and I explored basic css styling fundamentals.</p>

      <a href="https://keturahdev.github.io/johndoe/">John Smith's Resume</a>
      <p>Here was my first time practicing css styling with span elements. It was fun to come up with ridiculous content for
        a mystery man's resume. Threw it in the list because I thought you might get a kick out of it if you're a dork like
        myself.

      <a href="https://github.com/KeturahDev/KittyCode.git">KittyCode Online</a>
      <p>This is my very first webpage I ever made, about 2 years ago. It's very unorganized and the GitHub-pages currently
        does not work, but unside the repo you'll find many files where I have breif notes about what I was teaching myself
        at the time. Despite it being unpresentale currently, it has a good amount of sentimental value to me, and I look
        forward to cleaning it up within the next couple weeks in my spare time.</p>
